# Birds-Monitoring-Analysis
The project aims to analyze the distribution and diversity of bird species in two distinct ecosystems: forests and grasslands. By examining bird species observations across these habitats, the goal is to understand how environmental factors, such as vegetation type, climate, and terrain, influence bird populations and their behavior.
